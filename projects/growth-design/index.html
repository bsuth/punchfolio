&amp; Product Background" title="Direct link to Company &amp; Product Background">​</a></h2><p>Marley Spoon is a meal kit service that enables customers to make meal at home by sending recipes and ingredients directly to the door. Marley Spoon is currently operating in 7 countries, where Australia and the USA are the main regions. Up until now there are about 500K active subscribers and more than 1 million meals have been served.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problem--goal">Problem &amp; Goal<a href="#problem--goal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problem &amp; Goal" title="Direct link to Problem &amp; Goal">​</a></h2><p>Meal kit industry is a very competitive subscription industry that is driven with multiple types of vouchers to encourage the users to signup and continue purchasing with the brand. This opened up an opportunity to learn more about brand perception among the potential customers in order to optimize our conversions.</p><p>Partnering up with a Product Manager and a UX Researcher, we worked on a study using moderated interview to develop a growth design strategy for user acquisition. With the research, we aimed to <strong>gather potential customers&#x27; feedback, sentiments, and information needs across the early pages in a naturalistic journey way and to utilize the result to improve the signup-to-first delivery experience</strong>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-role">My role<a href="#my-role" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My role" title="Direct link to My role">​</a></h2><p>I am a product designer that took a role on user research on the project. I worked with a UX Researcher to develop the research plan, and questions. I also moderated the interviews and analyzed the data. After the research, I worked with a Product Manager on planning a future experimentation strategy and design using the insights.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-research-preparation">User research preparation<a href="#user-research-preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User research preparation" title="Direct link to User research preparation">​</a></h2><p>I teamed up with a Senior UX Researcher on user interview. We aimed to conduct the interview with the major markets; the US, Australia, and Germany. We selected 30 participants who had no experience with Marley Spoon but have been subscribing to at least one meal kit service at that time. The interview was expected to last about 45-50 minutes. The testing was focusing on the experience and the first impressions of the initial touch points on the desktop website.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="testing-flow">Testing flow<a href="#testing-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Testing flow" title="Direct link to Testing flow">​</a></h2><p>In total, we tested 8 different pages that the users might go through during their signup journey with Marley Spoon. The lineup of the pages included (1) marketing landing page, (2) homepage, (3) how it works, (4) menu, and (5) signup pages.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="user-flow" src="/punchfolio/assets/images/user-flow-17791e7f4f6479a1f263b12d31413351.webp" width="2137" height="996" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="insights">Insights<a href="#insights" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Insights" title="Direct link to Insights">​</a></h2><p>There are two main positive things that the users noticed from the journey. The first one is the signup discount. <strong>93% of the users agreed that the brand offered the generous discount for them to try out the first box</strong>. The second one is the images of the meals. <strong>100% of the users complimented that the meals looked delicious and sparked their interests to learn more about each weekly menu</strong>. 28% of the users explicitly mentioned that our brand offered more variety in the weekly menu than other meal kit services, which evoked positive emotions.</p><p>However, there were several negative sentiments. For example, <strong>87% of the users expressed direct and explicit negative sentiments about choosing meals being the last step after payment in the signup process. 37% of the users mentioned that the selecting delivery process was redundant</strong> but anyway it is straightforward and easy to understand. 20% of the users questioned about the unclarity of the discount display during the signup process.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-an-alternative-signup-flow">(1) An alternative signup flow<a href="#1-an-alternative-signup-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to (1) An alternative signup flow" title="Direct link to (1) An alternative signup flow">​</a></h2><p>As mention above, one of the biggest pain point for the potential customers was the inability to select the meals before paying in the signup process. We had taken that complaint into an account and try to find a solution for the users that is also suitable for the business.</p><p>The variant design enabled the first order payment to be done 3-5 days before the delivery date. Changing the entire signup flow is not an option due to the limited resources. We decided to use an A/B experiment to validate different leeways with users. In this way, the users still select their meal in the last step of the signup process but we remove the payment binding. With this solution, we believe that the users can feel that they will not have to commit to the subscription service from the beginning.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="impact--performance">Impact &amp; Performance<a href="#impact--performance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact &amp; Performance" title="Direct link to Impact &amp; Performance">​</a></h2><p>Over the 3 months before conducing the test, the overall conversion rate for acquisition was approximately 55%. With this test, the variant design was able to <strong>increase the conversion rate by 10%</strong> between the payment step and the choosing meal step. However, the cancellation rate and failed payment rate was increased as well by 7% with the variant design.</p><p>Despite the higher cancellation rate, <strong>the long-term value (LTV) of customers was raised by 3%</strong> and <strong>the variant design contributed to increasing the basket size of the first order by 4%. 20% of the users added more premium recipes and 38% of the users added additional market items into their box</strong>. The variant delivered a huge success that did not only tackle the problem with signup rate but also enabled an increase in average basket size.</p><p>Due to the higher cancellation rate, there are new solutions to improve the experience such as fast checkout after editing the first box, payment failure reminder via SMS.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="payment" src="/punchfolio/assets/images/payment-33ab9a854a35fccea554e915681b0a72.webp" width="1821" height="1022" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-reducing-lead-time-on-the-first-delivery">(2) Reducing lead time on the first delivery<a href="#2-reducing-lead-time-on-the-first-delivery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to (2) Reducing lead time on the first delivery" title="Direct link to (2) Reducing lead time on the first delivery">​</a></h2><p>Due to the long waiting time of their first delivery shown in the signup process, the users explicitly mentioned that they were reluctant to give the brand a try. It is common for e-commerce service to provide the fastest delivery, so the users expects to not waiting so long to receive their product. Apart from that, there were about 5% of the customers who had signed up cancelled their first box before it arrives.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="impact--performance-1">Impact &amp; Performance<a href="#impact--performance-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Impact &amp; Performance" title="Direct link to Impact &amp; Performance">​</a></h2><p>The new design was able <strong>to decrease of 74% in the first order cancellation</strong> due to the fact that the lead time has been reduced significantly for the users. This translates to approximately <strong>15% additional revenue for the first orders</strong>. By pre-selecting the fastest date for the users, the lead time can be reduced to an average of 3.7 days for the new customers.</p><p>With a huge success of this design, the operation has a plan to reduce the lead time even more to as short as 48 hours, so that the new customers can receive their first box even faster as purchasing a product from an e-commerce shop. It is also planned to apply the same design to the reactivating customers.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="delivery-selection" src="/punchfolio/assets/images/delivery-selection-b174fa09d8b1724d599389617406173a.webp" width="1774" height="743" class="img_ev3q"></p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#company--product-background" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Company &amp; Product Background</a></li><li><a href="#problem--goal" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Problem &amp; Goal</a></li><li><a href="#my-role" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">My role</a></li><li><a href="#user-research-preparation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">User research preparation</a></li><li><a href="#testing-flow" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Testing flow</a></li><li><a href="#insights" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Insights</a></li><li><a href="#1-an-alternative-signup-flow" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">(1) An alternative signup flow</a></li><li><a href="#impact--performance" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Impact &amp; Performance</a></li><li><a href="#2-reducing-lead-time-on-the-first-delivery" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">(2) Reducing lead time on the first delivery</a></li><li><a href="#impact--performance-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Impact &amp; Performance</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div></div>
