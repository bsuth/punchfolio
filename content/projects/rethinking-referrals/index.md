# Rethinking the Referral Program

In the competitive landscape of meal kit subscriptions, Marley Spoon has made its mark by delivering convenient home-cooked experiences to customers in 7 countries, with Australia and the USA as the biggest markets. Their focus on pre-portioned ingredients and diverse recipes has resonated with those who seek ease without sacrificing flavor. Since 2014, Marley Spoon has 500K active subscribers and over 1 million meals served, embodying convenience and culinary innovation.

**Many customers expressed dissatisfaction with the referral system, feeling it's unfair that the existing member referring a friend doesn't receive any benefits.** Responding to customer feedback, Marley Spoon recognized an opportunity to improve its referral program. The aim was simple yet crucial â€“ to show appreciation to customers advocating the brand. **The goals were obviously to reward customers for referring friends and family to become a meal kit subscriber with Marley Spoon.**

## Finding the Right Reward

I collaborated with product and CRM managers and we decided to let customer sentiments guiding our approach. Leveraging CRM, we launched the "Give & Get" campaign during Thanksgiving, presenting customers with a choice between a monetary discount or a delicious pie. **Results showed that the pie was superior, outperforming monetary rewards by 50% in the friend referral program.** This trend held strong across markets and reward variations. With this proof, we decided to move away from giving out tranditional incentives like discount and focusing more on rewarding customers with non-monetary items.

## Mapping the User Flow

From the success of the non-monetary reward in CRM campaigns, we outlined the first reward for the new referral program. Market items like desserts faced waste due to limited shelf life. Redirecting the referral program to feature these items offered dual benefits: customer rewards and waste reduction. Using a problem-opportunity framework, I drafted out users' needs and business goal. Then I designed a user flow of the new feature showcasing different scenarios and use cases on how customers can refer a friend and redeem a reward.

## Design Exploration

Beyond referral redesign, effective communication was important. I collaborated with a copywriter, crafting clear and engaging communication strategies to introduce customers about the new referral program. The referral landing page has transformed elegantly to educate and intrigue customers.

## From Vision to Reality

The new referral flow included reward claiming, communicative content, and dedicated product pages for each reward. I ensured to feature dietary information such as product descriptions, consumption instructions, ingredient lists, and allergen information enriched the user experience.

## Impact & Future Outlook

The results were striking. **Non-monetary rewards resonated deeply with customers, driving a 10% increase in referral acquisitions within a single quarter.** Moreover, by using market items as rewards, Marley Spoon anticipated reducing associated food waste by up to 30%. **As 2023 is approaching to an end, the outlook includes an annual acquisition of 12K customers and potential savings of $1M in media costs.** With this success, the path ahead holds exciting possibilities for us to experiments like household items as rewards or reward partnerships with other brands.
