# Automating Return Orders

## Company & Product Background

Emma Sleep GmbH, one of Europe's leading Sleep Tech companies, operates since 2013. The company has expended their brand to over 30 countries across the globe. The main product, the Bed-in-a-Box, is available for hassle-free online purchase through the Emma Sleep website. But what sets it apart is 100-nights-free trial policy, allowing customers to return and get a refund during this trial period.

## Return Overload

While the 100-nights-free trial resonates with customers, it creates a significant challenge for the customer service team. The manual return initiation process led to delays in processing returns, resulting in an increase of customer complaints. This challenge guided to the launch of the "Self-service Portal" project. **The goal was to empower customers to initiate returns themselves, reduce return processing delays, lighten the workload on the customer service team, and even suggest solutions to prevent returns.**

## Data-driven Insights

I collaborated not only with the operation and logistics team but also closely with the customer service team. Gathering complaints and return order data from customers was a crucial part of my design process.

Return orders were traditionally processed through calls and emails, with customers providing reasons for their returns. For example, a common reason in the UK was that "the mattress is too firm." In response, we offered a complimentary foam layer to soften the mattress, along with an extension of their 100-night trial. This offer resulted in a 60% reduction in mattress returns.

I mapped out user flows, considering all return reasons, counter-offers, and suggestions to understand the possible scenarios and start the design exploration.

## New Return Strategy

During my research, many customers asked if returned products were resold. To address this concern and reassure our customers, we introduced the "Charity Mattress" project. This initiative involved donating returned mattresses to disadvantaged groups, such as refugees. We successfully executed this program in Spain and Portugal, with the charity collecting mattresses directly from users' homes after returns were confirmed, followed by initiating refunds.

## Design

The self-service portal was first accessible through an email sent by the customer service team, when customers iniated a return. Within the first three months of implementation, the return rate remained stable. The ease of the self-service automation did not encourage users to return products unnecessarily.

## Impact

The impact of these initiatives was substantial. **Returns due to "mattress too firm" decreased by an impressive 60%.** Returns for other product categories decreased by approximately 18% thanks to tailored solutions. Customer service hours dedicated to processing returns were reduced by about 20 hours per week. Every returned mattress in Spain and Portugal found a new home through the Charity Mattress initiative.
