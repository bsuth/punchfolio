# Hey there, I'm Punch.

And yes, that's actually my name, thanks to my parents' creativity. I started in Thailand, then hopped across the globe to Germany for Anthropology studies. Little did I know, this journey would lead me to the world of UX design.

I found myself drawn to UX design and wanting to know everything about it. So, I dived deep, spending time in Estonia to master Human-Computer Interaction Design. Fast forward, I've been in the product design (UX/UI) for 5 years.
