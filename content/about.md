# Hey there, I'm Punch.

Yes, that's my actual name, thanks to my parents' creativity. I began my journey in Thailand and later went to Germany for my studies in Anthropology. Little did I know that this path would eventually lead me to the world of UX design.

I discovered my interest in UX design and decided to dive deep into it. I spent some time in Estonia to specialize in Human-Computer Interaction Design. Now, I have accumulated 5 years of experience in product design, particularly in UX/UI.
