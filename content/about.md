# Hey there, I'm Punch.

And yes, that's actually my name, thanks to my parents' creativity. I started in Thailand, then hopped across the globe to Germany for Anthropology studies. Little did I know, this journey would lead me to the world of UX design.

I was falling head over heels for UX design and wanting to know everything about it. So, I dived deep, spending time in Estonia to master Human Interaction Design. Fast forward, I've been in the product design (UX/UI) game for 5 years. I'm the wizard who crafts experiences, from unraveling user tales to bringing designs to life.

But here's the real twist â€“ I'm on a quest to become a "UX Unicorn." Imagine a designer who isn't just into aesthetics but also spins front-end magic, unearths user insights, and orchestrates interactions. It's like being a design superstar with a splash of unicorn glitter! ðŸ¦„âœ¨
